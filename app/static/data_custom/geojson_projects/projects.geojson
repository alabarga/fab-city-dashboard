Continued progress in the field has the potential to provide personalised, high quality solutions that are reliable and for a cheaper cost, making them more accessible for patients everywhere. These solutions have the potential to be especially revolutionary in fragile populations that have been affected by conflict situations and have extremely limited access to health care resources. By the end of 2013, over 50 million people across the world were forcibly displaced. Almost 20% of these cases comprised solely of Syrians, making Syria the largest source country of forcibly displaced persons in the world due to the ongoing Syrian Civil War. An estimated 200,000 Syrians have been seriously disabled by the conflict due to an amputated limb. More than 100,000 of these cases are children, of which 25% are upper limb amputations.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming need to introduce and develop innovative practices for the production of upper-body prosthetics was concluded through an initial fact-finding mission into Za\u2019atari, a refugee camp for Syrians fleeing the conflict located in Jordan. The study found that 10 out of 10 of the hospitals, clinics and NGO\u2019s operating in Jordan confirmed the need for a lower cost and more functional prosthesis. Digital fabrication practices have the potential to revolutionise the practice of prosthetic production and address these voiced concerns. However, the same study also showed the high risk of product rejection due to aesthetic reasons, highlighting the need for personalised designs and context-sensitive solutions. In this sense, prosthesis acceptance is the most pressing topic that needs to be addressed, not only to secure successful implementation within the community but also to effectively scale up the project to afflicted users within conflict zones worldwide.\r\n\r\nThusly, this thesis aims to present the research and development towards a new concept for digitally fabricated prosthetics, one that understands and respects the Syrian child refugees\u2019 current situations and perceptions to reduce device abandonment and improve satisfaction rates. The design process presented will demonstrate the possibilities of digitally fabricated prosthetics on user acceptance through investigations ranging from the aesthetics, to technical feasibility and understanding of the cultural context. These investigations consider the user\u2019s perception of the overall form and its ability to improve daily life, materiality to improve performance and mitigate loss of function, and lastly, integrating technology to mediate the user\u2019s behaviour and sensory perceptions of the surrounding environment. At least one site visit will be undertaken to Za\u2019atari to better understand the user by better understanding the built environment, and the local social, cultural and political situations. Additionally, the research will consist of test studies continuously throughout the design process to provide a feedback loop regarding the assessment and development of the design.\r\n<br>\r\n**<h6>Problem Statement</h6>**\r\n\r\nUpper-extremity amputees are estimated to number 650,000 worldwide, representing about ten per cent of amputees. The vast majority of these patients worldwide lack access to both prosthetic devices and to the health care infrastructure required to support them. A particularly neglected subset are the children in developing countries and conflict regions that incur traumatic loss, the most pressing being those casualties of the ongoing Syrian Civil War. These cases have a harder time adjusting than congenital cases as they have experienced the use of a normal limb as well as the anguish of the amputation, including the psychological challenges. They are even more problematic because of the urgent need to fit amputees within 3-6 months of the amputation, often referred to as the \u2018golden window\u2019, to ensure a high success rate for limb acceptability. Compounding these difficulties for child amputees is that their limbs are quickly outgrown and costly to replace, resulting in many families without options but to forgo prostheses altogether.\r\n\r\nNew advancements in technology are already showing signs of a new era of prosthetics. The democratisation of digital fabrication has opened the opportunity for manufacturing customised solutions in less time and for a much cheaper cost. But these solutions are designed with little to no consideration for the user\u2019s preferences. Prosthesis designs are currently designed for congenital cases as toys, in which the child sees the limb as an extension of their body capabilities, rather than designed to help alleviate loss. A practical upper-extremity design must take into account ease of production, fitting for comfortability, and material accessibility within extreme environments. These solutions need to consider the ergonomics of the user\u2019s surrounding to help mediate their experiences within their unique environments. Most importantly, these devices need to provide a tangible benefit for the user, both as a way to contribute to their personal identity and relationships and to help mitigate loss of function.\r\n<br>\r\n**<h6>Parameters for Biomimetic Modeling</h6>**\r\n\r\n.01 Knuckle-to-knuckle Length\r\n![Knuckle-to-knuckle Length](http://33.media.tumblr.com/1f410f7aba3144ac44a7fec3363a4050/tumblr_nrgio8tFUe1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.02 Metacarpal Length\r\n![Metacarpal Length]\r\n(http://31.media.tumblr.com/7a809b0f370c729bf34284f84b23b55c/tumblr_nrgin38SW21ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.03 Wrist Length\r\n![Wrist Length]\r\n(http://38.media.tumblr.com/7aa21e84685e59b2e05808667613b930/tumblr_nrgil0Jc7n1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.04 Minimum Distance between Tensioners\r\n![Minimum Distance between Tensioners]\r\n(http://38.media.tumblr.com/2676a0373374f1f269b39b0a7bb8a4da/tumblr_nrgii9iKVv1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.05 Wrist Width\r\n![Wrist Width]\r\n(http://31.media.tumblr.com/0230cb3b4917ac652e502325becb3506/tumblr_nrgigaTMWw1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.06 Wrist Height\r\n![Wrist Height]\r\n(http://38.media.tumblr.com/d0136302927cebcf000c493679f623d4/tumblr_nrgided67w1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.07 Finger Selection\r\n![Finger Selection]\r\n(http://31.media.tumblr.com/e550d2d4407a059d8d42dd2b55a4ec99/tumblr_nrgiavm0tL1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.08 Length of the Phalange\r\n![Length of the Phalange]\r\n(http://38.media.tumblr.com/424f3117a8053e35ca98021230897349/tumblr_nrgi9frsxU1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.09 Width of the Phalange\r\n![Width of the Phalange]\r\n(http://33.media.tumblr.com/9c02d8de43d9efdc61892e4f4aa1dd8c/tumblr_nrgi7uJg2U1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.10 Height of the Phalange\r\n![Height of the Phalange]\r\n(https://38.media.tumblr.com/ae700459f67ee3ca1373066142b1bd66/tumblr_nrgi4rmC5B1ualf7po2_r1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.11 Rotational Angle Axis 1\r\n![Length of the Phalange]\r\n(http://33.media.tumblr.com/39e6bff790537b026044f9a73a8bf271/tumblr_nrgi27Yo1g1ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n.12 Rotational Angle Axis 2\r\n![Length of the Phalange]\r\n(http://33.media.tumblr.com/163aafd4ce3dff7ff005068d42203d35/tumblr_nrghk9nxs51ualf7po1_1280.gif)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n**Lana Awad**\r\nDigital Fabrication Applied Research Program\r\nFab Thesis 2015", "lab_id": 142, "faq": "", "lab": {"links": [{"url": "http://fablab.fikket.com/", "id": 317}, {"url": "http://vimeo.com/fablabbcn/videos", "id": 316}, {"url": "https://github.com/fablabbcn", "id": 315}, {"url": "http://twitter.com/fablabbcn", "id": 226}, {"url": "https://picasaweb.google.com/fablabbcnphotos", "id": 16}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/FabLab.BCN", "id": 15}, {"url": "http://iaac.net", "id": 14}, {"url": "http://fablabbcn.org", "id": 13}], "lab_type": "Fab Lab", "county": "Catalonia", "postal_code": "08005", "country_code": "es", "id": 142, "kind_name": "supernode", "city": "Barcelona", "capabilities": ["three_d_printing", "cnc_milling", "circuit_production", "laser", "precision_milling", "vinyl_cutting"], "parent_id": null, "latitude": 41.3965511, "email": "info@fablabbcn.org", "blurb": "Fab Lab Barcelona is a centre of production, investigation and education, that uses the latest computer-assisted design software for the creation of prototypes and scale models.", "avatar": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/N2owmTJoSMOR2wousv66", "description": "Fab Lab Barcelona is a centre of production, investigation and education, that uses the latest computer-assisted design software for the creation of prototypes and scale models for Architecture, Construction and Industrial Design.", "phone": "+34 93 3209520", "header_image_src": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/sJw7EBcTxSXYG5IrgWYg", "slug": "fablabbcn", "name": "Fab Lab BCN", "url": "https://www.fablabs.io/fablabbcn", "longitude": 2.19416179999996, "address_1": "Carrer de Pujades, 102", "address_2": "", "address_notes": ""}, "facebook": "", "dropbox": "", "bitbucket": "", "github": "https://github.com/lanaaaaa/refugeeopenware", "url": "https://www.fablabs.io/projects/4", "vimeo": "", "created_at": "2015-06-19T19:48:42.618Z", "googleplus": "", "youtube": "", "drive": ""}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [41.3965511, 2.19416179999996]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"instagram": "", "cover": null, "twitter": "", "updated_at": "2016-04-06T10:01:04.976Z", "community": null, "id": 133, "web": "http://fablabbcn.org/popup_fab_lab.html", "title": "PopUp Fablab", "version": null, "scope": "", "flickr": "", "type": "Project in a Fab Lab", "lookingfor": null, "owner_id": 1933, "status": null, "description": "The Pop Up Fab Lab is a mobile Fab Lab, a basic infrastructure for small-scale production which small size allows movement and transportation to any location.\r\n\r\nThe Pop Up Fab Lab concept is to bring the Fab Lab to the public when the public cannot reach the Fab Lab.

A delta robot is a parallel robot that is designed for precise and fast movements of light payloads, generally used for pick-and-place/pack operations. The deltabot is composed of three two-segment arms/legs mounted in 120 degree intervals. The arms/legs use parallelograms to restrict the motion of the \"wrist\", the end effector. Wrist and elbow use ball magnets in order to keep the distance but not an certain angle, that is the magic of the kinematics and it's beautiful to watch how to position of the effector is  constantly being negotiated between the three servos. \r\n\r\nMy intention is to create a platform for Deltabots that are entirely fab-able (apart from servos and ball magnets probably). The interface is done in Processing Software and use serial communication to drive the servos and motors. I aim for an exchangeable end effector (you are able to attach any effector: extruder, drill/mill, brush, graffiti, light source, scanner, camera etc.) and for a scale bigger than desktop 3D printers and I can see also purpose in academia for an interactive machine like this. There are quite some Deltabots out there, DIY and industrial, servo and stepper motor based. I decided to go for a servo based one because it doesn\u2019t require those massive pillars on each corner and you are free to decide to hang it, build a cage etc. I based the design upon many references I found around the internet and I will provide all the sources (3D Files, cutting and print files, code).

The idea is that the farmer uses the app as an aid in decision taking for managing his crop, and the app and the weather station collect all the information and decide what activities need to be done in order to have a more productive crop. Additionally, the app has a stoplight alert in order for farmers to validate their crops on BPA, or good Agricultural Practices, a request for all farmers who intend to export their products.

One of those is the newborn death ratio. Most countries are fighting successfully against this problem but, unfortunately, a lot of work must be done. \r\n\r\nDeveloped countries treat preterm or underweight newborn babies using high technology devices such as incubators. These devices are very expensive, they cost between $ 6,000 to $ 60,000.\r\n\r\nUnderdeveloped countries hospitals cannot afford buying all the incubators they need. Despite many companies and hospitals donate materials (used and new) to the needed ones, their benefit might not be the expected.\r\n\r\nFirstly, medical personnel must be trained to manage high technology incubators. The newest incubators have a very accurate temperature and humidity control system. They are also smart and can send information to the surrounding computers. Training medical personnel to deal with this device can cost up to $ 4,000 per person.\r\n\r\nDeveloping countries hospitals environmental conditions may be harsh. For example, the temperature inside some buildings is very high or not regular (the same day can variate up to 10 Celsius degrees), there is sand or dust in the environment, etc. These factors can reduce the device life expectancy. \r\n\r\nOnce something breaks, it must be fixed. In developed countries this problem is usually solved by hospital technicians or call the support company. Unfortunately, small budget hospitals don't always have enough resources to buy the needed pieces or to hire people capable of fixing the device. Not to mention hiring the official device technical service.\r\n\r\nAlso, developing countries, have to deal with developed countries eradicated diseases and with patients that have to be isolated to avoid contagious diseases from spreading to other people. One example is the Ebola in Sierra Leona.\r\n\r\nThe lack of resources forces medical institutions to decide, for example, wether to focus on dealing against contagious diseases or decreasing the newborn death ratio. Unfortunately, most times the efforts are focused on dealing against contagious diseases. Therefore many infant deaths, that could be easily avoided in developed countries, are not avoided. This situation is caused by the lack of resources and most incubator devices high price.\r\n\r\nTo solve that problem, many hospitals and maternities are sharing incubators between more than one infant simultaneously. Two, three or even four newborns can be found inside the same device. Sharing an incubator can be dangerous, thus they are not isolated. If one of those contracts a contagious disease, probably, all of them will do it too.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in some developing countries, young pregnant women have food deficit caused by the country poverty. This situation worsens the infant situation. Even if the newborn is not preterm, he can be underdeveloped. Therefore, the number of infants that needs an incubator increases.\r\n\r\nThe need of a low cost and easily repairable incubator for developing countries is urgent. This thought can be extrapolated to many other medical devices.\r\n\r\nIn3 has one goal. Solve the problem described above with a cheap, modular, robust and easy to fix design.", "flickr": "", "type": "Project in a Fab Lab", "lookingfor": null, "owner_id": 3816, "status": null, "description": "In3 is a low-cost incubator developed during FabAcademy 2015.\r\n\r\nIt is the first prototype of a low cost incubator that aims to be cheap, easy to use and easily repairable device.\r\n\r\nThis device was designed to solve three big problems:\r\n- The incubator should be cheap and easy to use, so developing countries hospitals could get enough incubators.\r\n- Easy repairability is a must. This hospitals and maternities receive donations, but once those break they do not have enough resources to fix the high tech incubators. Those machines also need an expensive training.\r\n- Modularity: it can be personalized adding or removing modules as desired. Currently there are three optional modules: temperature controller, bluetooth module and the control panel. Selecting at least one of the last two modules is recommended. \r\n\r\nIn order to make it easy to reproduce I focused on using materials and techniques available on any FabLab around the world.

Satshakit modular boards have only the following modifications in confront of the standard satshakit: 4 extra pin headers (1 GND,1 VCC,1 A4, 1 A5). These pin headers serve also a structural pillars to build a modular satshakit tower.

But the main contribution of this project is the extreme optimization as a formal style that sets a challenge for all makers, designers and users around the world. \r\nDigital Fabrication makes possible to empower the user to make personalized things, but a huge power means a big responsibility, that is why a correct use of processes and resources is really important. Mixing the digital fabrication with analogical processes helps to make more competitive projects.\r\nThe Retazo Project started as an attempt to improve the process of nesting and efficiency of CNC cutting. Thanks to this improvement there are less material wastes and the machine working time is reduced. All the pieces of furniture \u201cRetazo\u201d are united with the common CNC joints that are really simple. The tables and chairs have a very intuitive assembly system, are user-friendly and at this way the use of analogical processes is promoted as a very useful complement to the digital Fabrication.\r\nWe wanted to design products with a style that considers functionality and efficiency to reach a really good design in the third industrial revolution.

Because of that we consider that Retazo is a challenge for each Maker.\r\n\r\nOptimization of Material: Using all the surface of the plywood board one can reach a perfect nesting process. The perfect nesting process means to not waste the material.\r\n\r\nOptimization of use of the Machine: While optimizing the nesting in an extreme way, the cut of pieces means also the cut of another piece. Also the time of cutting is reducing. The two of our tables could be fabricated in approximately 20 minutes depending on the machine characteristics that is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00bfWhat kind of cutter is better to use for milling?\r\nWe recommend to use a down-cut mill for the CNC, and for the fillet and finishing, a trimer tupia and a corner around router bit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00bfHow do you fix a board?\r\nOf course it is more difficult when you don\u2019t have a vacuum equipment because usually one fixes the board using the some instruments. Without the vacuum equipment one should look for some smart solutions. We prefer some strategies like using taps and screws in strategic positions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00bfDoes it means less freedom of personalization in the digital fabrication?\r\nThe \u201cRetazo Project\u201d is a challenge for all makers! Everybody can do more products with less material usage. It means that one has to think more on each design. So, each one will be planned better.

Usually, the goal of community self-build projects is a permanent building which requires a considerable amount of planning and financial resources. By self-building a temporary collective structure the community could enjoy all the benefits of a collective self-build project which can be started in a very early stage of the community development and ensure a healthy development for the community.\r\n\r\nThis could represent a more organic and decentralized approach to city equipment design in which physical infrastructures not only represent existing communities but help to create and strengthen those communities at an early stage.", "flickr": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/50381188@N06/sets/72157647049089174", "type": "Project in a Fab Lab", "lookingfor": null, "owner_id": 548, "status": null, "description": "Fab Lab Limerick from the School of Architecture at UL in collaboration with the Spanish-Irish design agency Colaborativa.eu is researching about the potential of digital fabrication and open source methodologies to generate low-cost construction systems. These systems are adequate for distributed manufacturing methods and can be used by the communities to self-build temporary collective spaces. We want anybody to be able to build strong, affordable and locally made geodesic buildings.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2013, it was developed a first prototype for temporary structures based on low-cost components and digital fabrication. This first geodesic dome was based in bamboo struts and 3d printed bio-plastic connectors. The assembly was carried out by three people in less than two hours and the prototype had an approximate cost of 4\u20ac per square meter.\r\n\r\nIn August 2014, Colaborativa.eu partnered with Fab Lab Limerick to develop a second iteration of the design, following the same principles of low-cost and digitally fabricated but using cardboard tubes and digitally fabricated plywood connectors instead. This change of materials allowed bigger domes with a span of up to 14 meters and 150 square meters covered area. This year Colaborativa.eu and Fab Lab Limerick are developing a deck and an inflatable cover for the dome.\r\n\r\nPaper tubes have great mechanical properties if they are kept with low moisture content \u2013an increase of just 1% of moisture content produces a loss of strength of around 10%\u2013 therefore finding a viable method for waterproofing the paper tubes is crucial. A two-step method has been found: first a moisture barrier ply is included below the first few paper layers, this waxy layer prevents moisture from penetrating deeper into the the paper tube. The second step is to apply an external waterproofing layer of a low volatile organic compound polyurethane. A more environmentally friendly solution is being considered for the next iteration of the prototype.\r\n\r\nA plywood hub detail is based on two principles. First, it had to be able to be rapid prototyped using laser cutting so each design iteration could be cut and tested at 1:1 scale as quickly as possible. Second, the hub needed to support the position of the paper tubes rigidly during the assembly process as the whole system was meant to be assembled without the need of auxiliary structures such as cranes, scaffoldings or additional supports.\r\n\r\nThe design offers a great resistance to wind and snow loads and can span up to 14 meters using very small and light elements. The system consists in a continuous tension, discontinuous compression structure of cardboard tubes connected by CNC cut plywood hubs which were developed in a fast iterative design process using laser cutting.\r\n\r\nWe believe that full-scale structural systems using Fab Labs for both rapid prototyping and manufacturing could open up innovation in building technology to communities all around the world", "lab_id": 286, "faq": "", "lab": {"links": [{"url": "http://fablab.saul.ie", "id": 548}], "lab_type": "Fab Lab", "county": "Limerick", "postal_code": "", "country_code": "ie", "id": 286, "kind_name": "fab_lab", "city": "Limerick", "capabilities": ["three_d_printing", "cnc_milling", "laser"], "parent_id": null, "latitude": 52.6659011, "email": "fablab@saul.ie", "blurb": "A space for makers in Limerick City", "avatar": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/E235Lj5Qta6af84BUzLC", "description": "Fab Lab Limerick started in 2012 as an elective course in which undergraduate students built open source 3D printers, CNC routers and laser cutters.

The sculpture would perform as a physical being controlling a mobile device, acting the same way as a digital bot yet in the physical world (5). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) [Lonely Sculpture](https://vimeo.com/93852159) (2014) by Tully Arnot \r\n(2) \u201cWhen computer scientists at Google\u2019s mysterious X lab built a neural network of 16,000 computer processors with one billion connections and let it browse YouTube, it did what many web users might do \u2014 it began to look for cats.\u201d (Liat Clark, [Wired UK](http://www.wired.com/2012/06/google-x-neural-network/) \u2014 26 June 2012) \r\n(3) \"Mars rover, Curiosity, takes a self-portrait and shares it with the world\u201d (Andrew Kalinchuk, [Digital Trends](http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/curiosity-takes-self-portrait-shares-with-world/) \u2014 9 September 2012) \r\n(4) \u201c[API Terms of Use](https://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/) [...] 1.

The final goal is find a cheap and fabbable version of a connected energy meter with data easy to understand.\r\n# Components\r\n### 1. The Hardware (working prototype)\r\nThe basic element of hardware is the Smart plug . An open source small plug that you put between the wall socket and the appliance and it is supercharged with the following features:\r\n* Lasercut acrilic frame by layers \r\n* Energy meter to monitor power consumption up to 20 Amps\r\n* Solid state relay to be able to switch ON and OFF the device remotely\r\n* Wireless WIFI connection provided by NodeMCU\r\n* LDR light sensor to automate ON/OFF cycles\r\n* Temperature sensor to automate ON/OFF cycles in temperature dependant devices.\r\nThat allows every Smart Plug to be independently monitored and controlled via Web or Mobile App.\r\n### 2. Android App (under development)\r\nIoT Android App is an Open source Android app developed using App Inventor that allows you to control and monitor Smart Plugs. Even kids can learn how to expand and grow this open source app to suit their needs and visual appearance.\r\n### 3. Modular IoT control panel (working prototype)\r\nWeb IoT Control Panel is a combination of JS applets, HTML templates and database that allows a user to store data sent from the sensors and to analyze and display them in a neat, simple and understandable way like a control panel. This can be embedded in existing web pages and can be used for Smart Plugs and any other kind of sensor like water meters, gas meters, weather stations, etc. It is based in the open source **freeboard.io** and **dweet.io** as open source platforms for visualizing and store of all kind of data. Freeboard allows to integrate also other kinds of data like weather stations and JSON streams.\r\n", "lab_id": 166, "faq": "# What is the cost and license of the hardware?\r\nAll the hardware is Open Source under MIT license.

This trailer has to be equipped with solar cells and a portable wind turbine so it must work as an autonomous charging station. Thus, the rider of the bike will be able to have an average of 60km mileage per\r\nday with just a light assistance. Also there will be enough space for the camping equipment needed for a long distance travelling.\r\n\r\nWhy Autonomous? \r\n     The Autonomous project aims to develop an alternative way for medium and long distance transportation. The targeted customers are the pedalecs users who would like to upgrade their equipment for national and international travels. Moreover, Autonomous provides an alternative way for energizing the battery of the pedalecs which reduces the cost for transportation and gives the freedom of recharging the e-bike at any place.\r\n\r\nHow is this good?\r\n     On a global scale there is a large amount of pedalecs on the road and currently unfolding European e-bike market [1]. Thus, there is a possibility in front of Autonomous to change the way of how the batteries of these e-bikes are charged. More precisely, the ability of Autonomous to recharge every e-bike battery from the solar power is in-line with the global movement for cleaner future with much less carbon emissions and as less fossil fuel as possible. In this direction, Autonomous reduce the fossil fuel usage by charging e-bikes \u2019out-off the grid\u2019. This reduces the demand for electricity from the grid which is mostly made out of coal [2] and this way reduces CO2 emissions because the process of producing electricity from coal is the greatest greenhouse emitter worldwide. By using Autonomous, every e-biker will be able to charge his bike without worrying about the power supply and this way it is proved that a long distance travels are achievable without an extreme efforts. A proof of this are Tour de Mongolia, Suntrip (from Italy, Milano to Kazakhstan, Astana) and the France-Japan expedition of Florian Bailly. All of the participants of these trips, that are thousands of kilometres long, have used solar trailers to recharge their electric bikes. In a long term, Autonomous will teach its users about the possibilities for solar powered travelling. As scientists expect much more effective PV to come [3] the knowledge of electric vehicles coupled with solar installations is something that has to be promoted to the society for the everybody\u2019s benefit of cleaner planet Earth.\r\n\r\nWhat is the innovation and the future work?\r\n     The concept of solar trailer for pedalecs is relatively new but it is already proven at a couple of long distance travels and competitions. For the purpose, a DIY Li-ion battery pack with the very efficient 18650 cells was assembled out of six-cell laptop batteries. The transformation of the laptop batteries was made in an original way by using minimal additional soldering. However, the Li-ion batteries are very delicate when it comes to recharging. Hence, the main problem was to overcome the difficulty of charging Li-ion cells from solar panels in a safe way. This was nicely done by using conventional Li-ion charger with DC input. Thus, after the battery was built and charging was conducted, everything else was just assembling the bits of the e-bike kit, the trailer and the wiring. Now, one can follow the step-by-step DIY instruction below and create his own electric bike with Li-ion battery pack that is capable to be recharged from different energy sources.\r\n     The future plan for Autonomous includes a portable wind turbine, a rare concept proposed once by Paul Smith in his trailer Navitas. However, Navitas seems not to be brought to the production thus, if Autonomous complete this task it will be the only wind harvesting trailer on the market. Moreover, in the future, when the current prototype passes some tests, a specially shaped fractal solar panels [4] will be applied, so the solar power could be harvested in a much more efficient way.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement\r\n      Autonomous started in FabLab BCN under the Erasmus for Young Entreprenuers program thanks to the Bulgarian Charities Aid Foundation and Fundaci\u00f3 Catalana per a la Recerca i la Innovaci\u00f3.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] \u201cThe Global E-bike Market\u201d, INSG Insight-No. 23, September 2014.\r\n[2] \u201cSources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\u201d\r\nhttp://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources.html\r\n[3] \u201cSolar cell efficiency\u201d\r\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/PVeff%28rev150806%29.jpg/1024px-PVeff%28rev150806%29.jpg\r\n[4] \u201cSolar Energy Generation in Three Dimensions\u201d\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.3266v2.pdf\r\n", "lab_id": 142, "faq": "", "lab": {"links": [{"url": "http://fablab.fikket.com/", "id": 317}, {"url": "http://vimeo.com/fablabbcn/videos", "id": 316}, {"url": "https://github.com/fablabbcn", "id": 315}, {"url": "http://twitter.com/fablabbcn", "id": 226}, {"url": "https://picasaweb.google.com/fablabbcnphotos", "id": 16}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/FabLab.BCN", "id": 15}, {"url": "http://iaac.net", "id": 14}, {"url": "http://fablabbcn.org", "id": 13}], "lab_type": "Fab Lab", "county": "Catalonia", "postal_code": "08005", "country_code": "es", "id": 142, "kind_name": "supernode", "city": "Barcelona", "capabilities": ["three_d_printing", "cnc_milling", "circuit_production", "laser", "precision_milling", "vinyl_cutting"], "parent_id": null, "latitude": 41.3965511, "email": "info@fablabbcn.org", "blurb": "Fab Lab Barcelona is a centre of production, investigation and education, that uses the latest computer-assisted design software for the creation of prototypes and scale models.", "avatar": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/N2owmTJoSMOR2wousv66", "description": "Fab Lab Barcelona is a centre of production, investigation and education, that uses the latest computer-assisted design software for the creation of prototypes and scale models for Architecture, Construction and Industrial Design.", "phone": "+34 93 3209520", "header_image_src": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/sJw7EBcTxSXYG5IrgWYg", "slug": "fablabbcn", "name": "Fab Lab BCN", "url": "https://www.fablabs.io/fablabbcn", "longitude": 2.19416179999996, "address_1": "Carrer de Pujades, 102", "address_2": "", "address_notes": ""}, "facebook": "", "dropbox": "", "bitbucket": "", "github": "", "url": "https://www.fablabs.io/projects/114", "vimeo": "", "created_at": "2015-11-09T14:29:27.498Z", "googleplus": "", "youtube": "", "drive": ""}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [41.3965511, 2.19416179999996]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"instagram": "", "cover": null, "twitter": "https://twitter.com/boarOircle", "updated_at": "2015-12-15T18:17:54.832Z", "community": null, "id": 115, "web": "https://aut0n0m0us.weebly.com", "title": "Autonomous", "version": null, "scope": "          The scope of Autonomous is covering the energy topic of the subject of sustainable development.
